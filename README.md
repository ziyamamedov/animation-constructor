# Animation Constructor

This is a simple animation constructor I made with React.js

In this project I implemented following features:

- **Selection** of an element.
- Adding **animations** to an element
- Viewing element's **initial position**
- Added **cubic-bezier** easing control(so the user can set their own easing)
- **Reset** animation button
- **Preview page**, where user can see how all the animations look
- Saving animation data to **local storage** and getting it from there on the preview page

Since I was limited in time while making this project, I wasn't able to implement all the features I wanted, such as adding keframes to the animations(0%, 50%, 100%). Hopefully I'll do that in the future
